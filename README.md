Trying to learn some different stuff, learn what i already wanted to learn before, and not confuse myself on all that trash content you can find online. I hope, from
the deepest abyss of my soul, that we, as human race, can fight and dominate these sins, these addictions, these weaknessess, because, if not we will suffer, more
to the rest of our brief lives. 
Hope i can help people, and insire them on the future, to be something that matters, to do something that really changes the game for me, to grind as much as i can and
stop breaking my promises, for any reason measurable.
